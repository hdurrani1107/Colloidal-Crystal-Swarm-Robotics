# Colloidal-Crystal-Swarm-Robotics
Exploring applications of colloids and crystallization in swarm robotics

Author: Humzah Durrani

Goals of this repository:
1. Conduct a robust literature review to develop an understanding of the field for potential applications
2. Develop basic simulations of multi-agent and swarm robotic policies for development and understanding
3. Narrow research down to an idea and experiment
4. Develop experiment and algorithms (hypothetical)
5. Record Results
6. Lofty Goal: Apply policies and algorithms into the real-world

# WORK IN PROGRESS

Will keep this continually updated
